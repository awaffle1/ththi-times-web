	Prehistorvia, who has suddenly reappeared, was recently asked to a meeting by Dwarf Land4 and said "No," mentioning that they were isolationist. Trying to tap communications, we found the Social Act and the Border Act. The Social Act blocked all social media programs are banned from a average Prehistorvian and are only allowed to be accessed by higher-ups/elites. The Border Act closes borders to everything but international trade, and even that will be constantly checked to make sure no one is trying to get into the nation. To move in or out of Prehistorvia, you have to go through a series of tests and pass them all. We here at THTHI Times think that these tests are physical or checking to make sure there's no information getting out.
