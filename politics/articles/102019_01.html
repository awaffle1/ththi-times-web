	In Rekken, a extreme version of Rekkenism has popped up, surrounding one of the main deities of Rekkenism, the Goddess Esper. The beliefs of this new group is straying away from the Rekkenist church. Their beliefs are so radical, in fact, that people have stopped calling them "Rekkenists," but rather "Cultists of Esper." When asked, a Kowenian religious official has said <q>The new beliefs have taken off within the Rekkenists in Khosrau and has mysteriously made it's way over to the Kowenian States, beginning to gather a following in Incheon City, Nakatoro, Central State of Kowen, and North Kowen.</q> Because of the situation, Empress Sievi of Rekken has banned the worship of Esper because of the nature of the movement, and has declared that offenders can face fines up to 1000 Munnies <em>(I'm not joking, it's seriously "Munnies")</em> and possibly imprisonment. Worship of other Rekkenist gods and goddesses are promoted instead.
