	<h3>October 13th 2019 - Doge Land - <span class="politics">POLITICS</span></h3></center>
	
	Following Kaisar's economic "collapse," a food shortage has appeared. They went to Moselie for help because of their excess potato fields, but in doing so makes them appear weak, not being able to grow food for their citizens. They are looking to open up agricultural trades with Moselie. We don't have much information now, but we will keep you updated in future issues.
