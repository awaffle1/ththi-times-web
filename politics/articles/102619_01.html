	Rekken vs Demira. That's one thing you probably haven't heard in a while. A civil war has broken our in Rekken, and people are taking sides quickly. Dushkaria has already jumped to the side of Demira, Archron is for Rekken, and we will see where this goes. My money's on Rekken. What about you? Telegram Doge Land with your answer. We'll keep you updated. We don't have much on it right now.
