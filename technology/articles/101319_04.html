	<h3>October 13th 2019 - Dushkaria, edited by Doge Land - <span class="technology">TECHNOLOGY</span></h3></center>
	
	Dushkarian scientists are happy to announce the construction of the world's biggest railgun. <q>It would surely revolutionize space travel, just think of all the money we will save by using it instead of those dirty rockets!</q> proclaimed one of the scientists while playing with magnets. Furthermore, this means that there will be a much cleaner and safer way to put satellites in orbit than any SSTO or rocket could ever achieve! To increase relations, Dushkaria will allow other nations to use it to put things in orbit.
